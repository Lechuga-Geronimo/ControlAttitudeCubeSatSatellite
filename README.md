# Implementation of a Cascade Control System for the Attitude of a 1U CubeSat Satellite.
Continuation and final stage of last project, where the proposal was implemented and tested, producing a paper for a national congress. 

## Year: 2016 - 2017.

## Abstract.

Progress is presented for the development of an orientation control algorithm for a CubeSat based on Cascade Control of two control loops. For this, an NXP KL25Z embedded system, a set of sensors and a reaction wheel are contemplated.

## Introduction.

The development of aerospace sciences is in a stage of accelerated growth in Mexico. Some research organizations such as the Mexican Space Agency and the Aerospace Development Center (CDA â€“ IPN) are increasingly interested in venturing into projects of this nature. This is where this topic arose, since the National Polytechnic Institute through the CDA proposed the creation of a CubeSat-type nanosatellite, which is called CDA-SAT1. This prototype is still in development, and although it has presented notable advances, it still lacks some subsystems such as Electrical Supply or Attitude Control. Due to the above, a control algorithm was generated that would remedy the need for attitude control for said satellite. The simulations were successful: it was demonstrated that said control system works and that it can be expanded to all three axes, with the ability to control the CubeSat in its three
